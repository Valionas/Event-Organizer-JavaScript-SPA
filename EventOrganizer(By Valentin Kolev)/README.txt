//IMPORTANT//

The application needs to be started by using a server ( Live-server, Lite server, Http).
The app uses modules for additional functionality, therefore it can't work properly without established server.

There are 3 external libraries which were used in the project :
	1) LitHTML - for DOM rendering and functionality;
	2) SweetAlert - customized alert functionality
	3) AnimateCSS - useful and free animation functionality

I've used live-server to test and capture the different outcomes in imageShowCase folder.
I've written comments on most parts of my JavaScript code to ensure that it is understandable.
